class Attack:
    """
    A base class for implementing adversarial attack strategies in federated learning.

    This class defines the interface for applying attacks that manipulate the gradient updates
    sent by malicious workers in a distributed learning setting.

        Applies the attack on the given inputs to generate adversarial updates.

        Args:
            inputs (list or tensor):  The input data for the malicious worker.
            targets (list or tensor): The corresponding target labels for the input data.
            honest_updates (list or tensor): The honest gradient updates from other workers, used as a reference.
            worker (int): The index or identifier of the worker applying the attack.
            gradient_function (callable): A function that computes the gradient based on the inputs and targets.
            weights (list or tensor, optional): Weights associated with the updates.

        Returns:
            adversarial_update (tensor): The manipulated gradient update generated by the attack.
